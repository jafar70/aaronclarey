                            Asshole Consulting is based on a very simple principle:<br>
                          </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="aboutus-text">Consultants will lie to you in order to spare your feelings, and in the process bilk you for as many unnecessary hours as possible</li>
                                <li class="aboutus-text">Assholes will just tell you the cold, blunt, truth because, frankly, they don’t give a shit about you.</li>
                                <li class="aboutus-text">And 15 minutes of truth is infinitely more valuable than 40 hours of lies.</li>
                            </ul>
                          <p class="aboutus-text">
                            And that’s how Asshole Consulting works.<br><br>
                            Thankfully, I’m an asshole.  I don’t care about your feelings.  I don’t care what you think about me.  And I make enough money doing other things I don’t need to worry about offending you or losing your business.  But that makes my advice not only better than most consultants’ and advisors’, but cheaper as well.<br><br>
                            I bill out at $100 an hour, but I have yet to charge somebody over $55 because nobody’s problem has required that much work.  Usually it is a simple question requiring my expertise or experience.  Perhaps it is something as simple as having another person’s opinion.  Whatever it is, for $20, $30, or $40 you can have that little tweak, adjustment or epiphany in life that explains everything and will likely save you thousands down the road.<br><br>
                            So whether you have a financial question<br>
                            You need advice on your career<br>
                            You are having trouble with the ladies<br>
                            Or anything else you think an older brother figure might be able to help in.<br><br>
                            
                            Consider dropping the $15, $25, maybe $55 on Asshole Consulting and see if a bit of direct, blunt truth doesn’t help.

                        Hello, I’m Aaron Clarey and I’m an asshole.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutus-text">
                        I dealt with enough incompetent corporate banking douchebags and their criminal clientele to know bullshit when I see it.  And my experience in dealing with frauds and idiots isn’t relegated to just the business world.  Batshit insane women, dealing with mortgage companies and the problems of homeownership, soulless universities, HR ditzes, the list is endless.  Unless you are significantly older or were particularly adventuresome in your life, I likely have more experience in life than you do.  And don’t think this is bragging.  I’ve likely made infinitely worse mistakes than you have.  Regardless, the point is you can benefit from my background and experiences, either where I succeeded or spectacularly failed.
                        <br><br>
                        Life has not been easy.  Matter of fact it’s been hell.  I won’t bore you with the details, but in short, I’m burnt out.  I’m all out of patience.  I’m done.  I no longer have the capacity to sit there with that soulless suit smile on my face, listening to middle age morons blather, and mindlessly nod my head.  Ergo, when I see the solution to a problem or a way to capitalize on an opportunity I’m not going to sit there silently, waiting for the appropriate moment to bring it to the attention of my boss.  I’m going to come outright and say it,
                        <br><br>
                        “HEY!  DUMBASS!!!!  The reason for your high employee turnover is because you don’t train them for shit.”<br>
                        “HEY!  FATASS!!!  The reason girls won’t go out with you is because you’re fat.  Loose the fucking weight!”<br>
                        “HEY!  DIPSHIT!!!!  What the hell is wrong with you letting your kid major in some worthless degree AND YOU PAY FOR IT???”<br><br>
                        There’s too many damn stupid people in this world, and acting like they’re all geniuses in the hopes of contracting future business is not my cup of tea.  I call it like I see it and it would be wise counsel to listen to me. the $15, $25, maybe $55 on Asshole Consulting and see if a bit of direct, blunt truth doesn’t help.

                      <p>Don’t be an idiot.  You’re being asked to blow $75,000 and four years of your life earning a degree.  You cannot afford to fuck this up and major in the wrong subject.  Don’t listen to that idiot “guidance counselor” of yours at high school.  She never worked in the real world and doesn’t know jack.  Listen to somebody who has lived in the real world.  Besides, compare the roughly $20 price tag it takes to consult the average prospective student vs. the $75,000 you’re going to drop on a degree.</p>

                      <p>You got girl problems. Who doesn’t?  Welcome to hell, son.  You have no idea how screwed up this aspect of life is.  And I mean that, dating in America and Western Civilization is an absolute insane asylum.  It’s worth dropping the couple bucks on a blunt and honest assessment of your physique, attitude, charm, and strategy, not to mention learning a thing or two about dating in the modern age.  Trust me, your sanity will thank you for it.</p>

You might as well pay me to do it for you. I charge an egregious fee depending on length, scope, and detail, and it is all payable UP FRONT. I do NOT “share in the profits” or “take a cut” as payment.</p>

                      <p> A lot of people are worried about the future of the country, not to mention the world. Consequently, they don’t know where to invest, where they should live, and what they should do.  I will confirm that the country is going to hell in a handbasket.  What you should do about it once again depends on your personal situation and what you want to do in life.  Might be worth dropping a couple bucks to give you some perspective on the country and the future so you can prepare for it.</p>

                      <h2>Business Consulting</h2>
                      <p>I worked in banking for 15 years and during that time I had the honor of sifting over thousands of tax returns and financial statements of companies and their owners.  This “wonderful” experience made me intricately aware of not so much what makes a “successful business,” but what idiotic, moronic, stupid, galactically fucking retarded mistakes make for a business that is doomed to fail.  From midlife-crisising men who wanted to run a “sports bar,” to the slack-jawed yokel hick that wanted to run his tracking company.</p>

                      <h2>Career</h2>
                      <p>A lot of clients either can’t find jobs, aren’t happy with their jobs, or found jobs, but it didn’t turn out to be anything as promised.  Naturally you’ll think there’s something wrong with you, but the truth is, most employers are lying scumbuckets and most jobs suck. It’s HARD to find meaningful and rewarding employment, let alone a career.  But you’re not going to find it listening to the HR ditz or asking some kind of “career coach” for advice.  Asshole Consulting will give you the skinny on how the labor market really works and how to succeed in it.</p>

                        <p class="aboutus-text">Upon confirming the funds are received, your question will be answered. The majority of clients opt for video responses (which can all be found on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AaronClarey">YouTube Channel</a>), but you can also receive an e-mail response or (for $200 an hour) a Skype consultation.</p><br><br>

                        <p class="aboutus-text">Depending on the complexity of the problem, there may be some follow up questions.</p><br><br><br>
                        <p class="aboutus-text">I officially bill out at $100 per hour, but the truth is most problems are solved within a 15 minute e-mail or so, so most final bills come in around $25 for an e-mail and $35 for a video.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

Not only have you pointed me in a great direction toward getting out of the mess I am in, but I have piece of mind and even less fear than when I e-mailed you for the consulting to begin with.</p>

Honestly, I’ve been watching more and more of them, and they’ve really been helping me stand up for *myself* to people in my life, especially women and getting shit on in my workplace. You’re making a difference out there to some of us without those *really* masculine figures helping our lives, Aaron, and we really appreciate it.” </p>
